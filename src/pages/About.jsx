        Turning Vision into
Interactive, Dynamic, and
Scalable Websites.
Hi, I'm a web developer based in Kathmandu, Nepal. I have over 5 years of experience and have worked on both the front-end and back-end parts of web development. I am proficient in various programming languages and frameworks including React, Next.js, Laravel and Wordpress.

I specialize in crafting engaging websites with captivating animations and intuitive designs that enhance user experiences. I also build dynamic web applications focused on performance and scalability.

My expertise includes developing custom content management systems (CMS) that empower clients to manage their websites with ease. I'm passionate about turning ideas into seamless, visually appealing, and functional digital solutions.
